# hello-world
Hello everyone!

My name is Katelyn. I just recently stumbled into coding and have fallen in love with it! I'm a say at home mom, 21 years old, with three children. My oldest is 2.5 and my twin boys are 1. I have spend the past year bouncing from hobby to hobby. Looking for one that will turn into a career. I came across someone talking about code and I immediately jumped on youtube to check it out. I fell inlove with it and want to learn more. I have decided that no matter how many bottles and diapers I juggle, I will make this into a career.
